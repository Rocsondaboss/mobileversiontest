        <p>This video was uploaded on January 27, 2017 by the uploader xCuts TM showing the boy being interviewed on stage. Set in the unspecified Tagalog-speaking Philippine province, the video shows the emcee first gives the boy question, "Bakit mo siyang paborito mong kainin?" The boy replies, "<i>Gusto ko po mag-artista</i>." The audience responded in laughter. The emcee clarifies the question to the boy by saying what the boy wants to eat. The boy replies, "<i>Gulay</i>" ("Vegetable[s]""). The emcee questions him why the boy wanted to eat vegetables. The boy replies, "<i>Para humaba ang titi ko</i>" ("To grow my penis longer"). The audience laughter becomes hysteric and to the point that the emcee pauses for several seconds before going to the girl beside him to interview her.</p>

        <p>As of this writing, the video earns 236 likes and 21 dislikes. Here's the comment below.</p>

        <p>This 13-second video was uploaded in April 2014 where the kid, from Philippines, singing Disney's <i>Frozen</i> theme song "Let it Go". In the video, we see the kid in the beginning singing chorus of the song, but after the kid coughs twice, the stuff coming out from his nose. The boy did not quickly wipe his stuff out; with the stuff still clinging on it, the boy stops the recording of the video. It is unclear whether the kid covers the song and deliberately expels his stuff from his nose as the meaning of "let it go" or it's just the fail moments.

        <p>This video was originated from Facebook source and it was re-uploaded in YouTube. The commentators on the video showing fun and disgusted (but it is funny anyway). His video was even caught attention by the girl (with an American accent) overseas, who lambasted the boy and found it disgusting. Her video was uploaded on YouTube but it was deleted since.</p>

        <p>The song "Let It Go" was the chart success.</p>
