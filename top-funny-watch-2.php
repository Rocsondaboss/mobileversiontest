        <p>The original video with the audio "million fans around the world" and walang aawat" was nowhere to be found on the internet (even searching on YouTube). However, the above-mentioned audio clip was commonly used in fight-theme videos, like this example above.</p>

    <p>This video showing groups of men riding an amphibious vehicle in the dirty canal when the boat capsizes in what was called the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)"><i>Titanic</i></a>" version. However, reaching to the shore, the boat capsizes and everyone else aboard soak wet. However, some Filipino online communities mistakenly assumed that the man in a yellow shirt was former President Benigno Aquino III.</p>

    <p>The video was actually captured in St. Inez Creek in India and that man in yellow shirt is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBLy0kySQxQ">Mayor Surendra Furtado</a>. The boat was designed to dredge garbages in the river and that would be used during the rainy season in the country. The video becomes the target of the memes used by the Indians, as well as Filipino internet users.</p>
